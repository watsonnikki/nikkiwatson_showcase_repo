# Key Features

**Interactive Visualizations:** Over 15 visualizations to explore critical health indicators.
**Modular Codebase:** Developed a multi-module Python project with clear separation of data processing, visualization, and prediction tasks, adhering to programming best practices.
**Predictive Analytics:** Built a predictive pipeline evaluating models like Linear Regression and XGBoost, using performance metrics to accurately forecast disease trends.
**Deployment:** Successfully deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with interactive features allowing global access for real-time predictions and data exploration.

## Scripts
There are 4 main scripts used in this analysis: main, EDA, machine learning, and vis. 

**Main:** Contains finalized HTML code deployed to GCP
**EDA:** Contains all data preparation 
**Machine Learning:** Contains the predictive pipeline
**Vis:** Contains all graphic content

# Technologies

**Framework:** Plotly Dash for dashboard development
**Machine Learning:** Implemented various models to enhance prediction accuracy
**Cloud Deployment:** Hosted on Google Cloud Platform for broad accessibility

# Insights
Designed to support public health decision-making by uncovering trends and providing insights into chronic disease data across the U.S.
