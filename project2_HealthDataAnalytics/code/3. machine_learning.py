These features (year, location, demographics) were chosen based on the EDA performed.
As evidenced in our graphs for obesity prevalence, there are clear trends among demographic 
groups, states, and year on obesity prevalence. 
The model was trained on these features in order to have the best chance of accurately 
predicting future prevalence of obesity. 
Additionally, when examining our data, we noticed that there are only four years, 2019-2022, 
and as such our models were finding very little correlation in obesity prevalence based on year. 
In order to predict future obesity rates, we decided that we needed data for additional years. 
We went to the CDCâ€™s website and found an extended version of the US Chronic Disease Indicators dataset, 
and pulled obesity data from the years 2011 to 2018.

"""
We evaluated each model using mean squared error, r-squared scores, and residual values. 
We evaluated three different models: a linear regression, a ridge model, and a Lasso model. 
The ridge model had an MSE of around 22 and an r-squared value of 0.61. 
The linear regression model had an MSE of around 14.9 and an r squared value of 0.75. 
The LASSO model had an MSE of around 23 with an r squared value of 0.61. 
Based on these values, we chose to use the Linear Regression model to predict the data.
