# Climate & Contagion: Examining the Effects of Global Warming on Flu Incidence in the United States

# Overview
This project investigates the relationship between climate change and influenza incidence by analyzing historical meteorological and disease rate data from 1997 to 2024. The study aims to understand how climate factors affect flu trends and to develop models to predict future influenza incidences.

# Objectives
1. Identify correlations between climate factors and flu incidences.
2. Develop and validate predictive models using historical data.
3. Assess models' ability to forecast influenza trends beyond one year.

# Methods
**Datasets:** Analysis used meteorological data from NOAA and influenza data from WHO and CDC, covering 1997 to 2024.
**Data Preparation:** Datasets were cleaned and formatted for analysis.
**Modeling:** Evaluated various models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) based on performance metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
**Correlations:** Investigated linear and rank-order relationships using Pearson and Spearman correlations.

# Key Findings
**Yearly & Monthly Analysis:** Found a stronger inverse relationship at the monthly level between temperature and influenza incidence.
**Predictive Models:** Random Forest and Support Vector Machines showed better monthly prediction accuracy. Linear Regression was effective for predicting long-term trends.
**Future Predictions:** Projected future trends suggest decreasing influenza incidences with changes in temperature extremes.

# Discussion
The study underscores a significant inverse correlation between lower temperatures and higher flu incidences, with implications for public health planning in the context of climate change.

Future predictive models should incorporate more meteorological variables and explore non-linear relationships.

# Limitations
Limited data scope and potential nonlinear relationships need addressing in future studies.

# Future Recommendations
1. Integrate more meteorological factors like humidity and elevation.
2. Consider advanced modeling techniques and accurate population forecasts.
